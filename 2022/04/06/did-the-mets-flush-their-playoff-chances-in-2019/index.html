<p>The New York Mets had legitimate playoff hopes in 2019. They had 10 players with higher than a 100 OPS+, the NL CY Young Award winner in Jacob deGrom and all six starters had an ERA+ of just below or above 100. So why didnâ€™t they make the playoffs?</p>

The meltdown game.</p>
<p>On a late night in early September, the Mets showed why when they gave up a six-run lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning to the eventual World Series Championship, The Washington Nationals.</p>
<p>After this nightmare of an inning, they gradually fell further and further from the last playoff spot. By game 162 the mets were four games behind the last Wild Card team, the Brewers.</p>

<p>While this was a historic choke by the Mets, The Nationals players that batted in this inning were some of the best in the league in 2019.</p>
<p>I am not putting Cody Bellinger as a refernece bc he is currently a fraud

<p>The Mets win expectancy was at or above 50% from plays 27-85. That means for 70% of games duration the Mets had a greater than 50% expectancy to win.

Paul Sewald came in to pitch the ninth, a slightly below average pitcher in regard to ERA and a respectable WHIP of 1.068, (Note he only pitched 19 full innings that year).</p>
