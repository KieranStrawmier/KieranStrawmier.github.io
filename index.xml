      <description>My Name is Kieran Strawmier. I am a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln double majoring in sports media and mass communication &amp;amp; advertising and public relations. My career interests are in the advertising/public relations field. I am looking to build experience with these skills in the sports industry. As a result of the course, (SPMC350), that required me to make this website, I am now looking to improve on my sports data analysis to potentially pursue a career in that industry.</description>
